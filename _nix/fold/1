      Yesterday Fred Wilson published a remark
      able post about missing Airbnb. VCs miss
       good startups all the time, but it's ex
      traordinarily rare for one to talk about
       it publicly till long afterward. So tha
      t post is further evidence what a rare b
      ird Fred is. He's probably the nicest VC
       I know.
