      Yesterday Fred Wilson published
      a remarkable post about missing
      Airbnb. VCs miss good startups all the
      time, but it's extraordinarily rare
      for one to talk about it publicly till
      long afterward. So that post is further
      evidence what a rare bird Fred is. He's
      probably the nicest VC I know.
