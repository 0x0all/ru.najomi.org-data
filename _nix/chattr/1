  BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
  The `c', 's', and `u' attributes are not honored by the ext2 and ext3
  filesystems as implemented in the current mainline Linux kernels. These
  attributes may be implemented in future versions of the ext2 and ext3
  filesystems.
   
  The `j' option is only useful if the filesystem is mounted as ext3.
   
  The `D' option is only useful on Linux kernel 2.5.19 and later.
